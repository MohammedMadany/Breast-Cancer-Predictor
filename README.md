## **Breast-Cancer-Predictor**

A **Breast Cancer Predictor** developed using Streamlit! Leveraging machine learning techniques, this tool analyzes cell nuclei measurements from biopsy data to predict whether cells are benign or malignant. Here’s what it offers:

- Interactive Interface: Users can input measurements such as radius mean, texture mean, perimeter mean, and more via intuitive sliders.
- Visual Insights: A radar chart visually compares patient measurements against average values, aiding in diagnosis.
- Automated Model Training: The app trains and tests a logistic regression model, providing accurate predictions.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes scaling and encoding for optimal model performance.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Python Programming: Developed the app using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit.
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression): Implemented a logistic regression model for classification.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, ensuring model readiness.
- Data Visualization (Plotly): Created radar charts for intuitive insights.
- Model Serialization (Pickle): Saved the trained model for future use.
- Web App Development (Streamlit): Built an accessible, user-friendly interface.

This project exemplifies how technology bridges gaps in medical diagnostics. By providing accessible tools for health professionals and researchers, we’re advancing cancer detection and potentially saving lives.
